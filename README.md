# AegisX - Extensible cryptography framework for Python 3.13+

**AegisX is a modern, extensible cryptography framework built for Python
3.13 and beyond. Designed with modularity, security, and developer ergonomics
in mind, AegisX provides a powerful foundation for building secure applications,
protocols, and systems. Whether you’re implementing custom encryption schemes,
managing keys, or integrating with existing crypto libraries, AegisX offers a
clean, pluggable architecture that adapts to your needs — without sacrificing
clarity or control.**

At its core, AegisX introduces a unified abstraction layer for cryptographic
operations, allowing developers to write secure code without needing to worry
about where key material resides — whether it’s on disk, in memory, stored
remotely, or managed by a hardware security module (HSM). This flexible
architecture enables seamless integration across diverse environments. AegisX
also aims to empower developers with rich, extensible support for widely used
protocols such as JOSE, OAuth 2.x/OpenID Connect, and PKIX, making it easier
to implement secure authentication, authorization, and identity management
workflows with confidence and clarity.

## Getting started

The AegisX codebase is organized for clarity and modularity. The core
functionality of the framework resides in ``./src/main``, housing the primary
interfaces and logic that power AegisX. Extension packages — including
support for higher-level protocols and additional features — are located
in `./src/ext`, while pluggable cryptographic backend implementations live
in `./src/backends`, allowing for flexible integration with various
crypto providers.

To set up a local development environment for all components, run the
following command in the terminal of your choice:

```
make
```

### Release cycle

AegisX follows a structured three-phase release process for all components:

- **Alpha**  
  All extensions and backend packages begin in the Alpha stage. Features are
  considered experimental and may change significantly. Alpha packages are
  suitable for exploration and early feedback but not recommended for
  production use.

- **Beta**  
  To reach Beta, a package must achieve **100% test coverage**. This phase
  indicates increased stability and readiness for broader testing and
  integration, though some refinements may still occur.

  Prior to promotion to Beta, a feature freeze must be declared over the given
  package.

- **General Availability (GA)**  
  GA status signifies that a package is production-ready. To qualify, it must include:
  - **Security hardening tests**
  - **Fully documented public classes and methods**
  - **Autogenerated documentation using Sphinx**
  - **Compliance with the project's coding standards** (see below)
  - **For extensions that implement a protocol, it must demonstrate compatibility with
    at least two other Python libraries that implement the same protocol.**

  Prior to promotion to GA, a code freeze must be declared over the given
  package.

### Versioning

AegisX adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to ensure clarity
and predictability in its release cycle. Each version is expressed as
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where breaking changes increment the **major** version,
new features that maintain backward compatibility increment the **minor**
version, and bug fixes or minor improvements increment the **patch** version.

This versioning scheme applies to the core framework as well as all officially
maintained extensions and backends, allowing developers to confidently manage
dependencies and track changes over time.


### CVE-Aware Dependency Management

The `aegisx.ext.cve` package provides curated dependency pinning to exclude
known CVEs from the AegisX dependency tree. These pins are not applied to other
packages in the framework to preserve backward compatibility and give
implementers the flexibility to enforce their own security policies.

For high-security environments, it is strongly recommended to install the
`aegisx.ext.cve` package to ensure that all dependencies meet stricter
vulnerability constraints.

The only exemption to this rule are CVEs in `aegisx` or one of its
packages. In such a case a patch is submitted and all dependants
must pin the new version.
