# Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)

**The aegisx.ext.jose module provides a high-level interface for working with
the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) family of standards, including
JWS, JWE, JWK, and JWT. Built on top of AegisXâ€™s extensible cryptographic
framework, this module simplifies the secure handling of tokens and key
material across authentication and authorization workflows. It is designed
to be both flexible and standards-compliant, making it easy to integrate
JOSE-based protocols into modern Python applications.**

## Installation

Installation is as simple as running the following command:

```
pip install aegisx.ext.jose
```

## Standards

- RFC 7515 JSON Web Signature (JWS)
- RFC 7516 JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
- RFC 8037 CFRG Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Signatures in JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)

## TODO:

- RFC 7515 4.1.6: Certificate chain verification for `x5u`/`x5c`.
- RFC 7515 10.13.: Unicode Comparison Security Considerations
